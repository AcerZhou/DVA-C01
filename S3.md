# Simple Storage Service (S3)

* Objects stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities
* S3 is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently

## S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed)
* data accessed less frequently
* require rapid access when needed
* Lower fee than S3
* Charged retrieval fee

## S3 - One Zone IA
* In a single Availability Zone (less redundant)
* 20% less then S3-IA (cheaper ?)

## Reduced Redundancy Storage
* 99.99% durability
* 99.99% availability
* data can be recreated if lost
* Suggest - Don't use, old service

## Glacier
* Very cheap
* Archival only
* 3.5 hours restore from glacier each time to retrieve

## S3 - Intelligent Tiering
* Unknown or unpredictable access patterns
* 2 tiers 
    - Frequent access
    - Infrequent access
* Automated move data to most cost-effective tier based on how frequently access
* optimizes cost
* A small monthly fee (monitoring/automation $0.0025 per 1000 objs)

### Charge 
* Storage (per GB)
* Number of Requests 
* Storage Management (Analytics, Object Tags)
* Data Management ( Data out of S3)
* Transfer Acceleration (Cloud Front)

## Security 
* All newly created buckets are private
* Buck Policy - control bucket level access
* Access Control List - Object level access
* Access log - log can write to S3

* A public access file can not be put into a private bucket

* Policy Generator & Policy Editor

## Encryption
* In Transit: SSL/TLS - https
* At Rest:
    - Server Side
        1. S3 Managed keys - SSE-S3 (AWS Manage keys)
        2. AWS KMS - SSE-KMS (AWS Manage keys)
        3. Encryption with Customer Provided keys - SSE-C
    - Client Side Encryption

* If using AWS KMS, the audit level can be applied

### Detail about Encryption
* S3 can reject request based on request header
* Using PUT request to upload file into S3 

* x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter
    - Will be included in the request header
    - To be encrypted at upload time

* Two options for the header
    - x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256
    - x-amz-server-side-encryption: ams:kms

S3 will encrypt the object using specific method
The Server Side Encryption can be enforced by using Bucket Policy
The request without header "x-amz-server-side-encryption" will be rejected

Sometimes, the policy can not apply on the resources, admin can add wild cast to all items in the resources

## CORS - Cross Region Resource Sharing
* using resource in one bucket to access resource in another bucket

## S3 Transfer Acceleration
* fast, easy, secure transfers of files
* over long distance
* between user and S3 bucket
* take advantage of Amazon Cloud Front's edge location
* data arrived at edge location 
* data is routed to S3 over optimized network path
* Objects are cached for the life of TTL

## Restrict Bucket Access
* Need to go through Cloud Front and need to give Cloud Front identity to access S3

* Signed URLs & Signed Cookies for special user
* WAF - Web Application Firewall - on Application Layer

## S3 performance optimization
* S3 designed to support high request rate

* If the workload is GET intensive, Cloud Front can be used
* If request are mixed type of workload, key name can impact performance

* S3 using the key name to determine which partition an object will be stored in
* Sequential key name likely to store on same partition

* Heavy workloads 
    - Cause I/O issues 
    - Contention
* Using a random prefix to key names
    - S3 will distribute keys multiple partitions
    - distribute I/O workloads

## Performance For S3
* 3,500 put requests/s
* 5,500 get requests/s
